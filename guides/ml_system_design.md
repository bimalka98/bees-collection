# Keep in mind

1. Massive models make ideal headlines, not ideal products. They are too expensive to train, too big to fit onto consumer devices, and too slow to be useful to users.
2. When asked by engineers to develop systems to be used in production, you need to keep the production goals in mind.
3. In school, you work with available, clean datasets and can spend most of your time on building and training machine learning models. In industry, you probably spend most of your time collecting, annotating, and cleaning data.
4. There are generally four main components of the process: project setup, data pipeline, modeling (selecting, training, and debugging your model), and serving (testing, deploying, maintaining).
5. Modeling, including model selection, training, and debugging, is what's often covered in most machine learning courses. However, it's only a small component of the entire process. Some might even argue that it's the easiest component.
6. When searching for a solution, your goal isn't to show off your knowledge of the latest buzzwords but to use the simplest solution that can do the job. Simplicity serves two purposes. First, gradually adding more complex components makes it easier to debug step by step. Second, the simplest model serves as a baseline to which you can compare your more complex models.
